My Cookie Manager is a browser extension for easy cookie management for every separate website.

Log in with your login and password to the website which cookies you want to save. In the extension menu, click the "Save cookies as a file" button. You can rename this file and place it anywhere. Next time, instead of entering your login and password for the website: click the "Load cookies from a file" button in the extension menu, then open your site.

This extension allows you to avoid annoying login and password entry on many websites. Especially if they require additional authorization via email or SMS each time.

At the bottom of the extension menu there are buttons for manually getting and setting the website cookies.

Do not share your cookies with anyone!
